# From Mrs Mendoza
Hello, After I had read your proposal my comments and your files are not accessible anymore - I will place my comment here

Your project topic is accepted and good work because I had seen your files in this repository but the requirements of the proposal 
were not met in terms of the following:

- your outline is missing, this could have been used as an overview of your website and to check your actual implementations.  
  This is also a guide in the development of your website.
- your wireframe lack cohesion and also several components....this could have been used as a guide in your development.

Lastly, your homepage should be named as index.html in order for your website to work....

Good luck!
